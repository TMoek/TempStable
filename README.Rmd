<!-- Start of my description -->
A collection of methods to estimate parameters of different tempered stable
distributions. Currently, there are seven different tempered stable 
distributions to choose from: Tempered stable subordinator distribution, 
classical tempered stable distribution (TSD), normal TSD, generalized classical 
TSD, modified TSD, Kim-Rachev TSD, rapidly decreasing TSD.
The package also provides functions to compute density and probability functions
and tools to run Monte Carlo simulations.

The main function of this package are briefly described below:

*   Main function: TemperedEstim() computes all the information about the
estimator. It allows the user to choose the preferred method and several
related options.
*   Characteristic function, density function, probability function and other 
functions for every tempered stable distribution mentioned above. 
E.g. charTSS(), dCTS(), ...
*   Monte Carlo simulation: a tool to run a Monte Carlo simulation 
(TemperedEstim_Simulation()) is provided and can save output files or produce 
statistical summary.

The package was developed by Till Massing and Cedric JÃ¼ssen and is structurally 
based on the "StableEstim" package by Tarak Kharrat and Georgi N. Boshnakov.

## Installation
Since we use the package "copula" and this uses C code, it may be that this 
package has to be installed manually beforehand.

TempStable is now available on CRAN! In R-Studio the package can be installed 
directly with the following command:
``` r
install.packages("TempStable")
```

You can install the development version of TempStable from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cedricjuessen/TempStable")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(TempStable)
## basic example code
# Such a simulation can take a very long time. Therefore, it can make sense to 
# parallelise after Monte Carlo runs. Parallelisation of the simulation is not 
# yet part of the package. 

# For testing purposes, the amount of runs and parameters is greatly reduced. 
# Therefore, the result is not meaningful. To start a meaningful simulation, the
# SampleSize could be, for example, 1000 and MCParam also 1000.
thetaT <- c(1.5,1,1,1,1,0)
res_CTS_ML_size10 <- TemperedEstim_Simulation(ParameterMatrix = rbind(thetaT),
                                               SampleSizes = c(10), MCparam = 3,
                                               TemperedType = "CTS", Estimfct = "ML",
                                               saveOutput = FALSE)

colMeans(sweep(res_CTS_ML_size10$outputMat[,9:14],2,thetaT), na.rm = TRUE)

```

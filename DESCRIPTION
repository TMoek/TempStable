Description: 
  A collection of methods to estimate parameters of different tempered stable 
  distributions. Currently, there are three different tempered stable 
  distributions to choose from: Tempered stable subordinator distribution, 
  classical tempered stable distribution, normal tempered stable distribution.
  The package also provides functions to compute characteristic functions and
  tools to run Monte Carlo simulations.
